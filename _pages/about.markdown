I am currently a graduate student at Purdue University's Design Engineering Lab, where my research focuses on computational modeling of design processes and analyzing human behavior in design contexts. Recently, my interests have expanded to generative AI-based design methodologies, particularly the potential to generate feasible designs that effectively satisfy specified constraints.

Previously, I completed both my bachelor's and master's degrees at IIT Bombay, where my research included projects on multi-agent systems, computational modeling of materials, and image processing techniques applied to cellular imagery. Through my academic coursework and prior research experiences, I have developed expertise in scientific machine learning, computational modeling of physical phenomena, uncertainty quantification, decision-making under uncertainty, probabilistic modeling, and Bayesian statistical methods.

Other interests: running, swimming, economics
